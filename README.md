- 👋 Hi, I’m @pim-dg aka Pim de Groot
- 👀 I’m working for Alilander but not exactly as a software developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to live and work from home.
- 💞️ I’m mainly using github to be able to resure and share content from / with my collagues.
- 📫 Leave a message if you want to get in touch.
